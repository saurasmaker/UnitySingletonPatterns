# Unity Singleton Patterns

This namespace contains 3 types of Singleton patterns to use in your Unity projects. 

The namespace "Patterns.Singletons" must be imported.

### Singleton
This class is a Singleton pattern for default class of C#.

## MonoBehaviour Singletons
The generic type T must be the class itself that inherits from SingletonMonoBehaviour.

#### Example 
```
using Patterns.Singletons

public class GameManager : SingletonMonoBehaviourPersistent<GameManager>
{ 
    override protected void OnAwake()
    {
        // TODO: Your functionality.

        /*
         * Equivalent to "void Awake()".
         * Override OnAwake() instead of use 
         * "void Awake()" method.
         */
    }
}
```

It is important to do not use "Awake" method of MonoBehaviour class. It will cause unwanted behavior. Instead of this methods, it is better to use "OnAwake" method that replicate the behavior of the previous one method.

### SingletonMonoBehaviour
All gameobjects that are intended to have a unique instance in the scene must inherit this class.

#### Persistent (Property)
This property will make the gameobject a "DontDestroyOnLoad GameObject.
This action can not be undone.

#### Instance (Property)
Get unique Instance of T class. If the instance has not been initialized, a warning will appear in console notifying that the property will return a "null" value. 

#### ForceInstance (Property)
Get unique Instance of T class. If the instance has not been initialized, the property will generate automatically the GameObject and will instance it adding the corresponding SingletonMonoBehaviour. 

### SingletonMonoBehaviourPersistent
All game objects that are intended to have a single instance in the entire game, regardless of the scene it is in, must inherit this class.

#### Instance (Property)
Get unique Instance of T class. If the instance has not been initialized, a warning will appear in console notifying that the property will return a "null" value. 

#### ForceInstance (Property)
Get unique Instance of T class. If the instance has not been initialized, the property will generate automatically the GameObject and will instance it adding the corresponding SingletonMonoBehaviourPersistent.
